Q1. fibonacci
Get the n-th fibonacci number


Q2. find-first-and-last
Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 25, 35], return [5, 35]) 
and makes a new list of only the first and last elements of the given list. 
For practice, write this code inside a function.


Q3. filter-only-even
Given a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 64, 81, 100] and return [4, 64, 100] 
Write program that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it. 

Bonus: Use only one line.


Q4. leap-year
Given a year and return if it's a leap-year.
input: 2000 and output: True.


Q5. Write a program that asks the user for a long string containing multiple words. 
Print back to the user the same string, except with the words in backwards order. For example, say I type the string:

My name is Mike

Then I would see the string:
      
Mike is name My

shown back to me.


Q6. buy-and-sell
Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock on day i.
If you were only permitted to complete at most one transaction (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock), design an algorithm to find the maximum profit.
Note that you cannot sell a stock before you buy one.

Example 1:

Input: [7,1,6,4,5,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.

Input: [7,4,3,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.


Q7. sting-contains
Write a function that takes sorted string with only numbers and find if a number (from 0 to 9) is in it. 
Example: 
string_contains("13589", 7) -> False
string_contains("00233", 0) -> True


Q8. strong-password
Write a strong password generator function in Python. 
Be creative with how you generate passwords - strong passwords have a mix of lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and symbols. 
The passwords should be random, generating a new password every time the user asks for a new password.
